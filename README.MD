# Microsoft Troubleshooter Py
This is a very, very advanced troubleshooter for Windows 10 machines. With an easy installation and completely accurate results, I personally guarantee that all of your computer issues will be resolved after running it. If you enjoy it, make sure you star this repo. <3

## Installation
You will need Python 3.5+ to run this script. You can get the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run it by opening the command prompt in the same directory that the script is located, and simply type in

```py "Microsoft Troubleshooter.py"```

... and let the script work it's magic.

OR

Simply download the .exe from the [latest release page](https://github.com/Payload9/Microsoft-Windows-Troubleshooter/releases/) and simply run it.
